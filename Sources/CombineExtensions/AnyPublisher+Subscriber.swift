    /// effect, which allows the reducer to handle them
    ///
    /// For example, one can create an effect to ask for access to `MPMediaLibrary`. It can start by
    /// sending the current status immediately, and then if the current status is `notDetermined` it
    /// can request authorization, and once a status is received it can send that back to the effect:
    ///
    ///     Effect.run { subscriber in
    ///
    ///         subscriber.send(MPMediaLibrary.authorizationStatus())
    ///
    ///         guard MPMediaLibrary.authorizationStatus() == .notDetermined else {
    ///             subscriber.send(completion: .finished)
    ///             return AnyCancellable {}
    ///         }
    ///
    ///         MPMediaLibrary.requestAuthorization { status in
    ///             subscriber.send(status)
    ///             subscriber.send(completion: .finished)
    ///         }
    ///         return AnyCancellable {
    ///             /// Typically clean up resources that were created here, but this effect doesn't
    ///             /// have any
    ///         }
    ///     }
    ///
    /// - Parameter work: a closure that accepts a `Subscriber` value and returns a cancellable. When
